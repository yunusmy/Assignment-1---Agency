# batch-3-assignment-1 Agency Landing Page - React Components

This project is the first assignment for the Learn With Sumit React Accelerator Batch #3. The goal is to convert a simple static Agency landing page into dynamic, reusable React components using Vite as the project bundler.

## Project Overview

The assignment is aimed at breaking down an HTML/CSS-based static real estate landing page into reusable, modular, and maintainable React components. The focus is on understanding how to transform a traditional webpage into a React-based UI while maintaining the same look and feel.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Front-end build tool for fast development
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the landing page
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For writing modular and dynamic code
